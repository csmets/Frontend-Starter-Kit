# Frontend Starter Kit

I created this project for future laziness. I've spent too much time grabbing
old projects or creating new ones from scratch, when I could just create a
simple framework to get me started on a project with all the best things I like.

**Note** This is not to replace the vue-cli and create-react-app tools that make
getting started so quick and easy, however I might consider replacing them with
this if I tinker to work with them and have a justified reason. At this moment I
see no point.

## Usage

```
npm install
```

Serve a dev site:

```

```
npm run watch
```
